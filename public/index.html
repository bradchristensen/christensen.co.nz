				<h1><span>I am</span> Brad Christensen</h1>
				<h2>Designer, developer and geek</h2>

				<h3>A little about me</h3>

				<p>I'm a <strong>software developer</strong> at <a href="//enlighten.co.nz">Enlighten Designs</a> in Hamilton, New Zealand, primarily involved with the front-end development of ASP.NET web applications. I'm currently contracted to <a href="http://lic.co.nz">Livestock Improvement Corporation</a> as an agile developer working on MINDA for the Web.</p>

                <p>I previously worked as a <strong>front-end developer</strong> for Canterbury-based <a href="http://kitemedia.co.nz">Kite Media</a>, and I was a <strong>graphic designer</strong> for <a href="http://haprint.com">H&amp;A Print</a> in Whanganui.</p>

				<p>In 2014 I wrote my <a href="//secure.wand.net.nz/~bec5/honours-thesis.pdf">honours thesis</a> on IPv6 networking for embedded devices running the Contiki operating system. I used the <abbr title="IPv6 over Low-powered Wireless Personal Area Networks">6LoWPAN</abbr> IPv6 abstraction layer to enable communication between devices on the Internet of Things with the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).</p>

				<h3>Things I like to do</h3>

				<p>I craft pixel-perfect websites using a variety of modern technologies, and I like to be involved in every part of bringing them to life. That sometimes means I am a wannabe Debian sysadmin and other times I might fancy myself a bit of an illustrator. Sometimes I even talk to people.</p>

                <p>Most of the time I like to occupy myself with code and have been particularly enjoying writing Javascript lately, both for the browser and the server.</p>
